# Description:
So, I recently worked on analyzing a large banking transactions dataset using Dask in Python, and then I visualized my insights in Tableau. The main challenge was handling a massive dataset efficiently because traditional Pandas was not cutting itâ€”it would have loaded everything into memory, making the process slow and inefficient. That's when I turned to Dask, which is built for parallel computing and works well with large datasets.Once I had my processed data, I moved everything to Tableau for visualization. This step was crucial because looking at raw numbers can be overwhelming, but visual representations make patterns easier to spot. I visualized a combination of graphs involving transaction details as row variables while date and account number as column vaiables.This resulted in line graphs revealing the trend in case of each customer based on the transaction details.
Overall, using Dask for efficient data handling and Tableau for visualization was a great combination. Dask made it easy to process the massive dataset without running into memory issues, while Tableau brought the data to life with clear and actionable insights.
